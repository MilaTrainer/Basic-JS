            <h1>Some text about</h1>
            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by
                feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a
                four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from
                the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand
                living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose
                development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and
                elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further
                evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic
                island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
                Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further
                evolved for swimming.</p>
            <p>Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds
                are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives
                are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include
                Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA
                evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified
                dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the
                pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds
                are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
                cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species
                are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time,
                sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one
                male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by
                laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and
                incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.</p>
